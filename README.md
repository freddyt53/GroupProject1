Our website is intended to alleviate the stressors that come with getting a parking ticket.  Providing a single place for individuals to catalog and organize parking citations.  Parking citation are not only frustrating, they can quickly spiral out of control if they are not paid.  With our website the user can enter a parking citation number to review data related to that citation.  Additionally, a user can opt to receive a text message reminder 24 hours before the parking citation is due to avoid late fees.  

The conception of this app stemmed from one of our team memberâ€™s collection of parking citations and personal experience with how difficult it can be to manage multiple pending tickets.  Through a discussion of shared experiences we identified the potential benefit that an app like ours could present.
